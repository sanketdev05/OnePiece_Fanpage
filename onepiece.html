            Gol D. Roger was known as the "Pirate King," the strongest and most
            infamous being to have sailed the Grand Line.<br />The capture and
            execution of Roger by the World Government brought a change
            throughout the world. His last words <br />
            before his death revealed the existence of the greatest treasure in
            the world,One Piece.It was this revelation that brought <br />about
            the Grand Age of Pirates, men who dreamed of finding One Piece—which
            promises an unlimited amount of riches<br />
            and fame—and quite possibly the pinnacle of glory and the title of
            the Pirate King.<br /><br />

            Enter Monkey D. Luffy, a 17-year-old boy who defies your standard
            definition of a pirate. Rather than the popular persona of <br />a
            wicked, hardened, toothless pirate ransacking villages for fun,
            Luffy's reason for being a pirate is one of pure wonder: the
            <br />thought of an exciting adventure that leads him to intriguing
            people and ultimately, the promised treasure. Following in the<br />
            footsteps of his childhood hero,Luffy and his crew travel across the
            Grand Line, experiencing crazy adventures, unveiling <br />dark
            mysteries and battling strong enemies, all in<br />
            order to reach the most coveted of all fortunes-One Piece.<br /><br />

              Luffy is the captain of the Straw Hat Pirates and is best friends
              with all of them and values them over all else.At first glance,
              Luffy does not appear to be very intelligent, often seeing things
              in a childish manner and can easily be amazed by the simplest
              things. However, because he views the world in a straightforward
              and simple manner, he is occasionally the only person who can see
              past the events and see what should be done. Luffy's dream is to
              find the One Piece and become Pirate King. He knows that to
              achieve his goal, he will have to defeat many strong opponents,
              including the World Government and his childhood hero Shanks.

              Zoro was the first crew member to be recruited by Luffy. Zoro is a
              skilled swordsman who fights with his own unique sword style known
              as santoryu (three katana fighting style).This is achieved by
              using one katana in each hand and another in his mouth. He is also
              seen fighting with only one or two swords. When in a serious fight
              he ties his bandana, normally tied on the arm, on his head. He
              also never tries to escape from a fight or use trickery to win,
              believing that doing so is cowardly and scorning anyone who uses
              such tactics. Zoro is very vigorous, strong-willed, and
              determined.

              Sanji is the chain-smoking chef of the Straw Hat Pirate Crew. He
              has superb fighting skills that only make use of his legs, in an
              effort to minimize damage to his hands which would impair his
              cooking skills. Sanji uses an array of powerful and varied kicking
              moves when he fights. His cooking skills are world class, and he
              was mentored in both cooking and fighting by Chef "Red Leg" Zeff
              of the Baratie. He was born in the North Blue, but grew up in the
              East Blue.

              Usopp is a liar and likes to play pranks on his crew members or
              just goof off with Luffy and Chopper. The other aspect of Usopp
              besides his lying is his cowardice;he is a very timid person,or so
              he thinks. In extremely stressful situations,Usopp has proven to
              be far more courageous than he believes himself to be. He shows
              great resolve when his friends are threatened or mocked by
              outsiders. Even though he is a complete coward in battle (except
              as his alter ego, Sogeking), he is a useful part to the Straw Hat
              Pirates. He is extremely handy and can fix almost anything.

              which means "whale shark" in Japanese. His epithet, Kaikyou would
              normally translate into "Strait" or "Channel." However since the
              kanji for it is written as (海侠の) and not (海峡の), the kyou
              part (侠) of it comes from (任侠), a honorific used when
              addressing a high ranking yakuza member, thus making his epithet a
              Japanese pun.
